	Magius:
Hello there traveller!
My name is Magius, the great mage!
What... What? You just- you don't care?
Well, nevermind that... This island is dangerous, you should take this.
You'll be safer this way, surely you care about not dying.
	Finished Dialogue:
Go on, get going already!
	Attacked Dialogue:
Ow! What the hell? I regret giving that thing to you.
	Magius' Brother:
You talked to Magius over there huh? Yeah, he's a weirdo.
I guess he gave you a sword or something? Weird for a mage to do.
Anyway, if you're going in that there cave, be careful. 
Aint nobody there to help you.
	Finished Dialogue:
Be safe out there.
	Attacked Dialogue:
Maybe Magius was right, just this once.
	Boat:
You came all the way here, after all that.
No going back now.
	Finished Dialogue:
The boat reminds you of home.
	Attacked Dialogue:
You idiot.
	Chest:
	Finished Dialogue:
All that remains is this chest. What's this?
